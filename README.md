## TO DO


fix user model
- start location into
    - Location ID
    - Street
    - City
    - Zip Code
    - State
    - Name







Notes:
- only works for streets
    - you'll need to enter/find 852 W Main Street instead of simply typing Flats at West Village
- may consider adding map pinning or better results
- current fields are kinda dummy, I could reorganize stuff or add new things depending on our needs but since the model has been really volatile, I'm not going to bother with perfecting that atm.
- Can change the form labels to rename funny things like "State Administrative Area Level 1", but it felt too time consuming or simply hard to understand google api and map our names to their names.
